# Defining our CSV to JSON app

Let's define what functionalities and requirements our CLI tool should have:

- This program should take a CSV file path as an argument and generate a JSON file using the same data.
- The JSON file should contain an array, where each array element represents a row from the input CSV file.
- All the JSON data is of string type.
- You will be able to generate a “well-formatted” (indented) JSON file.
- You will be able to indicate whether the input CSV file is using “comma” or “semicolon” as the column separator.
- This program must have a “help” option, to know how to use this tool.ol
